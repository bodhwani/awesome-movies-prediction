["This movie takes the Golem from the 20s movies and puts him in a museum where he is found by Roddy McDowall's character who brings him to life and wreaks havoc.", 'I loved it.', "Unless you want to traumatize your kids and give them nightmares, do not under any circumstances bring them to this film, especially if they're afraid of clowns!", 'It is so terrifying, weird, and hard to watch at times.', "But I think if you're at least 13 you can handle this.", 'It is also very thoughtful unlike most other horror films.', 'Most of the material that makes this film rated R mostly involves children and young teens.', 'The clown may be found disturbing to some.', 'Children are bullied, tortured, and sometimes murdered!', 'SPOILER ALERT!', "A kid gets his arm bitten off by a clown and is dragged into a manhole-we see poor kid's lost arm and blood flowing.", 'A teenage boy is forced to kill sheep.', 'Kids cuss in the movie as well.', 'This movie is a lot of fun for horror fans though!', 'VERY mature 13 year olds should be able to watch this.', 'Just know your children before taking them.', 'Violence:  8/10:   Okay, so in the first 15 minutes a kid gets his arm completely torn off while his blood flows down the water in the road (This part is one of the worse parts).', 'A guy gets a bolt gun and shoots a sheep in the face.', 'Kids get punched and kicked in the face several times causing them to bleed from the nose by some douchebags.', 'Throughout the film, some kids hallucinate zombie lookin people with the skin on their face pulled apart.', 'A guy gets his throat pierced by a knife and he bleeds out on screen (most violent in my opinion).', "'It' chews up an arm.... yeah.", 'Other minor stuff happens like getting speared, slashed, bitten etc, all of which arnt too graphic.', '(note: the violence has a very cartoony feel to it)                            \n                Swearing: 6/10:   The swearing is okay but frequent.', 'They only seem to say fu*k and sh*t every 4 minutes, and sometimes use other words like sl*t, bit*h, assh*le, etc.', 'Drugs 1/10:   At the beginning of the second scene in the movie, you can see a girl smoking in a toilet cubical.', 'Some beers left around but nothin really.', 'Sexual stuff: 4/10:   Everyone in a school keeps calling a girl a sl*t. That same girls dad is a pervert towards her...... Quite a lot, kids make dick jokes.', "Near the end of the movie, i'm 90% sure someone was trying to rape a kid.", 'Scary stuff: 6/10:   This movie does have a creepy atmosphere at some times, but not always.', 'Almost all of the scares are cheap jumpscares so there not to bad.', 'Some parts can be really stressful in the film.', "So yeah there's what i thought.", "I left out a bit in violence for spoilers, but they weren't to bad that i needed to mention them....", 'I was disappointed with the film because there is gore in it and more than needed vulgar language.', 'Scary does not equal gore.', 'I would much more recommend the classic version of "It", as it leaves things up to ones imagination and doesn\'t have graphic violence.', 'IT is a phenomenal movie, the acting is great, the scares were intense and well done, the music was great, the writing was (surprisingly) hilarious, and the pacing was spot on.', 'IT can be quite gory at times, and those afraid of clowns will have an extra-terrifying experience.', 'Overall, IT is an excellent movie and is a lot of fun to go and see with friends, although may be a bit too much for those younger than 14.', 'I think that this movie is awesome.', 'i Would not let kids under 11 watch its a bit scarey.', 'Sorry about my spelling it not the best, but the movie is the best.', 'This movie is the bomb dot com.', 'Much better than the mini series and very scary.', 'Not much sex at all but a lot of swearing and quickly made penis jokes.', 'Pennywise is not for the faint of heart and scared the crap out of me.', 'At first, I was a little skeptical about seeing It due to the source material and the track record of most recent King adaptations.', "After watching It, I have to say this is one the best and unique horror films I've seen in recent memory.", 'There is a lot to love about this movie.', 'First off, the child actors all give great performances.', 'They had powerful chemistry and engaging back-and-forth dialogue which really sold me on their friendship.', 'I liked how each individual had a certain attribute (such as stammering, bickering too much, being too nervous or picked on constantly) which added to their personalities and distinguished themselves in their so-called "Loser\'s Club".', "Even the actors portraying the bullies were great in encapsulating a psychopathic nature targeting the Loser's Club.", 'I also really loved how despite the fact that a clown is terrorizing their city, these characters are still kids and mature to face their fears as the film goes on.', 'A major theme of It is fear, and that is where the clown Pennywise comes in.', 'Pennywise is very scary in this movie, especially during one really intense scene where the kids are using a projector.', 'This clown is not only fearful, but he feeds on the fears of the main characters and creates chilling illusions that only the kids can see.Most of the horror films that have come out recently usually contain teenagers/young adults making dumb decisions, leading up to a cheap jump-scare.', 'However in this film, the scares work because the kids are genuinely facing their fears (loss of a family member, a scary painting, an abusive parent) and there is a proper buildup of tension.', 'A lot of this is due to the smart writing and witty dialogue between both the kids and the villain Pennywise ("You\'ll float too.', '": one of the most memorable lines I\'ve heard in a while).', 'In the end, It was a surprising, entertaining, scary horror flick.', 'I definitely recommend It!', ':)', 'IT is a very creepy movie, more creepy than scary.', 'The movie is creepy on and big level.', 'There is only a couple of jump scares, but still makes an impact.', "I'm not normally a big fan of horror, but I like IT because it has a Great Story.", 'The acting and characters are all amazing, but the standouts are Finn Wolfhard as Richie, Jack Dylan Grazer as Eddie and Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise.', 'Overall IT is a great movie worth seeing.', "It's fine for teens 14+ as the movie is too disturbing and creepy for younger viewers as kids die in gruesome ways.", "I'm 11 years old but quite mature for my age.", 'I love scary movies but this one was boring.', "I was so excited to see it in theaters, but I didn't even flinch.", 'This was more disgusting then scary.', "If you get scared easily, go ahead, but for kids like me who barley get scared don't bother.", 'The reason I think this should be 14+ is not because its scary, but because it has many swear words and things not appropriate for kids under the age of 14.', "To be honest, I don't really know why people seem to think It is scary.", "Yes, there are a few unexpected jumpscares, but there's nothing really over the top.", 'One kid gets his arm bit off, although you dont really see anything.', 'Just blood.', "I guess it's kind of violent, but it's even with the comedy.", "everyone in the group swears a lot, and there are bullies that are really mean to people and cut H's in their stomach.", 'It teaches you about friendship and staying together, which i like.', "Beverly's dad is also abusive to her, but then she smacks him in the head with a vase, and then Pennywise jumpscares her.", 'A bully also stabs his dad in the neck because he embarrased him in front of his friends.', "Don't be like that guy.", 'Also, he gets pushed down a drain.', "I guess that's what you get.", 'There is a lot of blood, but most of it is comical.', "Such as most of Pennywise's jumpscares.", "Whenever hes about to eat someone he shakes his head and body like he's having a seizure.", "It's weird.", 'Mainly why it isnt very scary.', 'Just pay attention to the funny parts and dont try to imagine it, because thats why you get scared.', "Anyways if you do end up watching it, don't try to scare yourself.", "It's not even real.", "Plus, the book is the one that's scary!", 'IT is a terrifying movie based on a best-selling but gruesome Stephen King novel.', 'Although it is rated MA15+ (R in America), the violence is what you would expect from a M (or PG-13) rated horror movie, such as moderate amounts of blood and heart-stopping moments.', "For this reason, IT is rated MA15+ because it is so scary younger kids couldn't handle it.", "IT was an enjoyable movie, with some great, Stranger-Things-esque 'kids being kids' humour and bonding.", 'I would not, however, call it horror (more like an adventure thriller).', 'There are a few predictable jumpscares, and a whole lot of blood, but nothing that will leave viewers truly rattled.', "The R rating is mainly for swearing and terrible innuendos; Bev's dad is much more disturbing than It.", "I would recommend this movie if you're waiting on season 2 of Stranger Things, but not if you're looking for true scares."]
